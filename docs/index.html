    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The UIUC Re_home webapp is a tool to monitor and control the home. Necessarily, the webapp must be hosted by a server somewhere; the ideal solution for this is to host the project from a server on the Local Area Network within the home. For our project, we have purchased a modest computer and used a combination of common open-source software to serve the project to client devices, e.g. iPad. The app uses a LAMP software stack to host the application. The linux distribution of choice in this project is Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. This guide will provide all commands based on an Ubuntu system.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="hardware">Hardware Specs</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The Re_home webapp does not require significant resources. The primary focus for making the decision on server hardware was small size, quiet operation, and low-energy.</p>
      <p>A complete list of the server hardware used to serve the webapp:
        <ul>
          <li>Barebones Mini-Top with 1.8GHz Dual-Core Atom and NVIDIA ION 2 - <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=56-107-072">Jetway HBJC600C99-52W-BW</a></li>
          <li>2GB DDR2 800 RAM - <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148162">Crucial CT25664AC800</a></li>
          <li>50GB Solid State Drive - <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227531">OCZ Agility 2 OCZSSD2-2AGT50G</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>To provide a home network, a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=33-124-190">Linksys WRT54GL</a> router was set up. Additionally, <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato">Tomato</a> v1.28 was installed as custom firmware. The motivation for this was to use the Static DHCP feature in Tomato. The router was configured to always assign the server the IP address 192.168.0.110. Without reserving a specific IP address for the server, the link to the app on the iPad would get outdated if the router was ever restarted.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="software">Installing & Configuring Software</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The following software is required to host an instance of the Re_home application:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi">Apache 2.2</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">MySQL Server 5.1</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://php.net/downloads.php">PHP 5.3</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Download and install each of the linked software packages.</p>
      <span class="code">sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql</span>
      <p>Next set up a new virtual host in apache to serve the site. The following is an example configuration file that would be stored in /etc/apache2/sites-available</p>
<pre>&lt;VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName uiucrehome.domain.com
    ServerAlias uiucrehome
    DocumentRoot /var/www/uiucrehome/public
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
    LogLevel debug
   
    &lt;IfModule mod_deflate.c>
        AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css text/javascript text/xhtml application/x-javascript
    &lt;/IfModule>
&lt;/VirtualHost></pre>
      <p>Don't forget to make a link to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled when you are done. Restart apache.</p>
<pre>cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
ln -s ../sites-available/uiucrehome
sudo apache2ctl graceful
</pre>
    </div>

    <h2 id="repository">Setting Up the Repository</h2>
    <div>
      <p>In order to get the project files, they must be cloned from the git repository hosted on github. Following from the given apache configuration, put the repository in /var/www</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/signup/free">Sign-up</a> or <a href="https://github.com/login">login</a> for github.</li>
        <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/download">Download</a> and install git</li>
        <li>Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/cmswafford/uiucrehome">uiucrehome repository</a> on your system.
          <span class="code">git clone git@github.com:cmswafford/uiucrehome.git</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
         <p>This will create a folder named uiucrehome in your current directory. This project will have all the files necessary to host the application.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="database_struct">Database Structure</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The database has 7 tables: <i>categories</i>, <i>rooms</i>, <i>devices</i>, <i>power_logs</i>, <i>temperature_logs</i>, <i>water_logs</i>, and <i>solar_logs</i>.
	  The database is created with a structure convenient for the user interface. </p>
	  <p>The user interface has the option of viewing total power consumption from each room or from each category. 
	  In order to grab power data for each group, each device in the <i>devices</i> table has a category ID and room ID. 
	  Each device in the <i>devices</i> table also has the column for <i>off_or_on</i>, information that will also be used by the power monitoring page for the status of each device. 
	  The <i>metadata</i> column for the <i>devices</i> table is used to store information about the object each device is monitoring, such as the name of the object, manufacturer of the object, life expectancy of the object, and/or the date the object was bought.</p>
	<p>The <i>categories</i> and <i>rooms</i> tables are used for matching the names of each category and room to an ID number. Each of the logging tables, <i>power_logs</i>, <i>temperature_logs</i>, <i>water_logs</i>, and <i>power_logs</i> are used to store all the relevant data for monitoring each device. The columns of the logging table consist of the ID of each logging entry, the device ID that the logging entry is associated to, the logging data relevant to each type of monitoring, and the time that logging entry was created. </p>
	<p>For the <i>power_logs</i> table, the relevant data for power monitoring that is stored is the RMS voltage, RMS current, apparent power, real power, power factor and power factor angle. The relevant data stored for the <i>temperature_logs</i> and <i>water_logs</i> table are each currently set as one column named <i>value</i> because the temperature and water monitoring devices have not been set up to connect with the server yet. The <i>created_at</i> column for each of the monitoring devices is used to store the time of each logging entry. This data can be used by the user interface to either display instantaneous logging data, or data accumulated over a period of time. By using the <i>created_at</i> column for each logging table, the user interface is able to display graphs that show logging data spanning from the last four hours, to the last three days.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="modify_log">Logging Data Modification</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The value column for the temperature_logs and water_logs tables can easily be modified for the purpose of each type of monitoring device. This is done by editing:</p>
	  <ol>
        <li>the file <span class="code2">uiucrehome/public/include/uiuc.sql</span>. This file is editing by adding/modifying the line <span class="code2">,value FLOAT DEFAULT NULL</span> for the specific logging table to include in the database the relevant data columns needed.</li>
       <li>the corresponding file under <span class="code2">uiucrehome/lib/models</span>. In this file, the array needs to be edited by adding/modifying the line <span class="code2">,'value' </span> according to the data columns added to the logging tables. </li>
       <li>the file <span class="code2">uiucrehome/scripts/insert_log.php</span>. By following the example of the power logging data, the line that needs to be modified is <span class="code2">$aData['value'] = $argv[3];</span> to include the data columns added to the logging tables.</li>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>After editing these files, the php script <span class="code2">insert_log.php</span> can be run successfully to insert monitoring data into the database.</p>
	<p>As mentioned above, the <span class="code2">insert_log.php</span> script is used to insert data into the database. This script is called with at least three arguments: </p>
	  <ol>
        <li>the type of logging: power, temperature, water, or solar</li>
		<li>the device_id</li>
		<li>data values, in the  or solarorder specified by the script</li>
    </ol>
	<p>The script <span class="code2">PowerRead.php</span> in the folder <span class="code2">/uiucrehome/scripts</span> is specifically used to read power data from the Xbee chip and log into the database. This script can be called with a cron script to set up the server to log data repeatedly every few hours, minutes or seconds. The temperature and water monitoring devices can follow the layout of the <span class="code2">PowerRead.php</span> script to read data through the serial</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap Process</h2>
      <p>For PHP files in the app to take advantage of the PHP framework, they must be bootstrapped. To initiate this process, the file must include the /lib/http/bootstrap.php file. The bootstrap file includes the config file, sets constants, and includes all the necessary library files. Finally the database model objects are initialized and the database connection is created. After a script includes the bootstrap.php file, it may successfully use the DB api to access and modify database records.</p>
